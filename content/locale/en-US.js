We prepared a cheeky pitch with in-depth research and compelling samples. In turn, this mysterious client lovedloved our work and picked us in a heartbeat.",

        "meeting.para3": "This is what we did with Mauj. At the begging, Mauj started with another name – one that carries hidden meaning. They were likely going to encounter some obstacles, or reach an unintended audience that was unlikely to support their message. After we won the pitch (with flying colors!) we suggested they change their old name to another one more in line with their vision and direction, and this required many intensive sessions together to convince them of the need for change – after which we absolutely fell in love with their new choice, Mauj.",

As the words came together, visions of the brand became clearer, and we were, in a sense, helping set the foundation for Mauj's emeregence. That was the ground from which we took off to write their social media content.",
        "tone.para2": "We knew very well that addressing topics on women's sexual health was unfamiliar but also necessary. This is why we always vet the best and smoothest to introduce these topics, and how the audience could join in on a constructive conversation. Mauj's social media launched in September 2020, gradually delving into more \"taboo\" topics throughout a six-month period.",
        "tone.para3": "What makes our work exceptional with Mauj is our collaboration with their team. We think together about which topics to discuss, and about the dates of publication, contemplating whether or not a post is suitable for its publication date, or if there's an event that would be in conflict with the content? We also help them develop their ideas; they are dear clients and valuable partners, and we love what they do with their work and the limits they push.",

They are willing to bend over backwards to get us to meet our objectives, and that kind of partnership doesn’t come easy.
