    "intro.para": "Mauj is one of our most prominent, stimulating, and challenging projects. What we love most in Mauj is how aware their team is of what they present and how they present it, and their consideration of the culture of their audience of Arab women. We also love the way our writers balance between their beautiful poetic tone, and clear and direct educational method.",
    "meeting.title": "How did we meet?",
    "meeting.para1": "In February 2020, we submitted a pitch for their new project, knowing nothing at the time except that it is a platform concerned with women's sexual and reproductive health. We began preparing the presentation and research content, and were working very enthusiastically seeing as Mauj is moving in a relatively new direction for the Arab region. We put all our effort into what we did and Mauj, in turn, loved our work and writing style right away – and we won!",
    "meeting.para2": "At Mauzoun, we don’t consider ourselves to be a writing service provider only, but rather as creative partners; explaining to clients our opinion from a creative perspective.",
    "meeting.para3": "This is what we did with Mauj. At the begging, Mauj started with another name – one that carries hidden meaning. They were likely going to encounter some obstacles, or reach an unintended audience that was unlikely to support their message. After we won the pitch (with flying colors!) we suggested they change their old name to another one more in line with their vision and direction, and this required many intensive sessions together to convince them of the need for change – after which we absolutely fell in love with their new choice, Mauj.",
    "tone.title": "What about our tone of writing?",

    "tone.para1": "When it was time to decide on their tone, we chose to write in a lovely poetic tone, to complement the particular character and rhythm of Mauj, and is why we chose <u>we're glad you came</u>. From there we set out to write their Brand Manifesto. It was one of the first things we wrote for Mauj, and as the words came together and the vision became clearer, in a sense, we were setting the foundation stones for Mauj. That was the ground from which we took off to write their social media content, launching in September 2020, and starting a new journey.",
    "tone.para2": "When we started writing, we knew very well that addressing topics on women's sexual health was unfamiliar, but also necessary. This is why we always ask ourselves what the best and smoothest way could be to introduce this content to the readers, and how the audience could join in on a constructive conversation. When we started in early September 2020, the posts were introducing the content to the audience, and delving gradually into the topics to eventually reach where we are in March 2021. We did this because one of our most important values at Mauzoun is to take into consideration Arab culture and Arab audiences, as they form a priority for us and for our clients.",
    "tone.para3": "What makes our work exceptional with Mauj is our collaboration with their team. We think together about which topics to discuss, and about the dates of publication, contemplating whether or not a post is suitable for its publication date, or if there's an event that would be in conflict with the content? We also help them develop their ideas; they are dear clients and valuable partners, and we love what they do with their work and the limits they push.",
    "brand.title": "A flexible business relationship led to an integrated brand.",
    "brand.para1": "With their deliberate management, brilliant illustrations and our written content, Mauj received 37K followers in the first five months alone, without ever resorting to promotions or paid advertisements, and as of this blog’s date of June 2021, they now have more than 53K followers. 12 of the posts we wrote for them received 80% more engagement than average. What we love the most about Mauj is how they balance sharing knowledge with promoting their products, without one side overshadowing the other.",
    "brand.para2": "Sometimes ideas seem to come out of nowhere, especially with new brands. You may arrive at fresh and daring concepts, which we at Mauzoun support with every client; regardless of how bold the idea or the limits it may push.",

    "testimony.para1": "<b>Mauzoun won us over with the first page of their proposal.</b> Their in-depth research, cultural references, insightful analysis, and brilliant, witty writing sealed the deal.",
    "testimony.para2": "<b>We were not only looking for excellent writers, we were seeking strategic partners</b> who could think with us (sometimes for us), help us better understand our regional audience, engage in future planning, and who are equally invested in the success of the business. That’s exactly what the Mauzoun team is.",
    "testimony.para3": "They have mastered the Arabic language, are culturally tapped in, understand the ins and outs of social norms, always add their creative magic to all that they do, and are up for a challenge any day. <b>The harder the brief or ask, the more excited they get and the better the work.</b> They inspire us to up our strategy, put out better work, think harder, and act faster. They are willing to bend over backwards to get us to meet our objectives, and that kind of partnership doesn’t come easy. We are so thankful to have such an impressive group of strong, smart, and witty writers who we get to call our partners."

    "intro.para1": "When we first met Suha Musa, she told us about her dream of opening a store that narrates the story of date fruits, and merges the essence of innovation and novelty. Ever since that moment, we envisioned her space and worked with Suha towards realize her dream. It's been a year since we set out on our journey together, with its course continuing to unfold.",
    "intro.para2": "Our client, Suha Musa, is one with a clear and particular aspiration and tranquil voice, and she chooses her words with careful deliberation. When discussing Musa and Palm, she opts for the phrases “date and gift shop” and “café experience,” formulating her ideas with a distinct precision that guides us through our writing process.",
    "longStory.title1": "Long story short: four rounds of naming, yet the final choice fell on the first suggestion.",
    "longStory.para1": "'Musa and Palm' was the first suggestion we made. What was amusing and delightful was that Suha wasn’t sure about the name the first time around, so she asked that we try again. Our team of writers had gladly obliged, researching and presenting new suggestions that could satisfy her exceptional taste.",
    "longStory.paraX": "After consulting her friends and family, everyone unanimously agreed on allure of Musa and Palm, Suha was convinced. The final approval was given, and we moved to the next stage.", 
    "longStory.title2": "A precise tone and an impeccable brand dictionary.",
    "longStory.para2": "The process took time: in order to achieve the balance between the venerable and the beautiful, and to combine the two with innovation, our team of writers needed to study and comprehend many references. It's an imperative step in order to dive into the specifics of the terminology and the artistry of language, and to refine an expression wholly unique to the identity of a brand that aims to utilize innovation as a means for illustrating heritage and authenticity.",
    "longStory.para3": "Our mission at Mauzoun has been to celebrate the venerability of the date fruit, along with the history and cultivation of the palm tree, all while ensuring that the brand voice remains innovative and delightful and not outdated or familiar. Now, we can say that we excelled in understanding Musa and Palm's request, and thus a story was born, and the brand's captivating content was written to represent its identity and embody its vision.",
    "process.title1" : "We adopt one word, and exchange another.",
    "process.para1": "What makes working with Musa and Palm exciting and continuously growth-oriented is that they give us the time to write, and to write well, without rushing to receive a draft, as they are fully aware of the process which precedes writing: of the research, analysis, and drafting of a specific tone. They are also wonderful clients who help us with sources of inspiration, as well as listening to our suggestions with an openness and sincere interest.",
    "collab.title1": "A synergy of brand elements and brand content.",
    "collab.para1": "While we were writing the brand content, oSuha continually updated us with her brand's elements, from the color palette to even the team's uniform design which painted a clear picture of the brand's look and feel in the minds of our writers. This brought our perception close to reality and increased our understanding of the brand, helping us create a strong, rooted, and integrated tone of voice for the brand.",
    "collab.para2": "Writing is a creative process in which we look to the meanings of the graphics and colors, mulling over their both their significance and the impressions we receive. When we make sure to take these details into consideration, our words attune to the elements of the brand to creating a strong, rooted and integrated identity.",
    "invitation.title1": "An invitation brimming with abundance.",
    "invitation.para1": "Our dear Suha extended our team the invitation to visit her shop, and from the moment we walked in, we grasped the meaning of innovation and understood why Musa and Palm insisted on using that term to describe their products. The experience of a date fruit filled with goat cheese and topped with slivers of dried tomatoes is no way an ordinary experience!",
    "invitation.para2": "Reading what we wrote and witnessing it in print was one of our happiest moments. How delightful it was to see the fruits of our year-long labor, and how incredible it feels to grow alongside our clients, to believe in their dreams, and to strive together to bring those dreams to life.",
    "invitation.para3": "Abundance enriches every corner of the shop: it was not only a term used in writing their content, but the principle our dear Suha treated us by. It is the principle she made certain to apply with Musa and Palm, offering date fruits generous in their ingredients, and cultivating a flourishing relationship with kindness and generosity.",
    "testimony.title": "And here is Suha’s narration of her story with us:",
    "testimony.para1": "What distinguishes Mauzoun from everyone else is their precision in asking the right questions, the extensive research they undertake for any project, and the wealth of language that they pair with their professionalism and flexibility. They not only assist with writing the project; they are with you hand-in-hand, helping you with ideas that are not only for the content they provide, but sometimes for the project as a whole.",
    "testimony.para2": "The Mauzoun Team is pleasant, organized, and their office is also equally lovely. The work they do is intelligent and diligent, and they style of writing is consistent, specific, and excellent. I feel that the content Mauzoun writes is there to stay for years, without the need of revamping it anytime soon, because they always write in a timeless way and are not easily swayed by fleeting trends in writing.",
    "testimony.para3": "They are trustworthy, loyal, and will always be completely honest with the client. I always feel like I’m part of their family of work. I would absolutely recommend Mauzoun to public and private sectors alike, and I continue to recommend them to all my friends and family."
